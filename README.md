# Lumina
Lumina is a flexible and powerful first-person shooter framework for the Godot game engine. It provides a solid foundation for creating captivating FPS games.

## Getting started
To get started with Lumina, simply download or clone the repository, and import the project into Godot _(any version after 4.0)_, then open the `Lumina template project` and wait for everything to import.
After everything finished importing, press `F5`. If Godot reports no errors, then Lumina has been setup successfully!

## Further docs
Take a look around in the Wiki section for more documentation!

**Lumina** is released under the MIT license, which is a permissive open-source license that allows for the use, modification, and distribution of the code without any warranty. However, the MIT license requires that the original copyright notice and permission notice be included in all copies and substantial portions of the software. This means that if you use Lumina in your project, you must include attribution to the original creators of the code and somewhere visible to the end user. This attribution can be as simple as including a comment in your code or acknowledging Lumina in your game's credits.

Including a mention of Lumina in the credits, main menu, or in a credits text file is fine.

_(Or you can just leave the splash screen as it is and you'll satisfy the requirement lol)_

# Lumina
Lumina is a flexible and powerful first-person shooter framework for the Godot game engine. It provides a solid foundation for creating captivating FPS games.

## Getting started
To get started with Lumina, simply download or clone the repository, and import the project into Godot _(any version after 4.0)_, then open the `Lumina template project` and wait for everything to import.
After everything finished importing, press `F5`. If Godot reports no errors, then Lumina has been setup successfully!

## Further docs
Take a look around in the Wiki section for more documentation!
